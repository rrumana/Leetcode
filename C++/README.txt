In this file I wil be posting C++ Leetcode Solutions. 

Each solution will be in its own file with the question number on it.

Again, this is just to document my practice, this is not a repository to find Leetcode answers.

DISCLAIMER: 

These are not plug and play solutions! If you paste this into Leetcode it may not work for a variety of reasons. These are the C++ main files I used for development and testing, and therefore contain a main, test cases, different imports, and don't use namespaces, among other possiblke differences.
