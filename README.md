# Leetcode

This Repository is now being managed on Ubuntu VM

Just a collection of Leetcode questions I have done as of recent.

Each solution will be posted with an accompanying README talking about the solution, my process, where I struggled, and the time and space complexity.

This is not meant to serve as a Leetcode answer key. I am just going to do a few solutions a day to derust and prepare for coing interviews.

I am just trying to learn, but if you learn something too that's great!
